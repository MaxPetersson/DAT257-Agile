Project Scope:

The project can be divided into two parts.

#1. The main-plattform. A user-friendly, easy accesible, web site will be created that serves
as a face (front-end) for SIRI and Netex data from the RTF data hub.

It will display, in a time-table-fashioned way, the departures and arrivals of ferries within
the selected harbour. 

Different modes will allow different level of details. As the user clicks/engages departures/
arrivals more information will be shown.



#2. The plattform(#1) also serves as a add-on plattform for further services. These includes 
(but are not limited to) a subscription services and a company-specific service/site.

	The subscription-service is aimed at an end consumer who, for whatever reason, wants
to track the departure or arrival of a certain ferry. This can be both a individual passenger
or a lorry-driver that is planning to pick something up.

	The company-specific site/service will function as a customizable part of the plattform
for a specific company. For example if Stena Line wants different levels of notification to
different levels of employees they can add and change notifcation settings.



Conclusion:
A plattform that (in its basic form) displays departures and arrivals for ferries and ship in
a selected harbour. With the ability of adding on additional services. For now we have two
of these additional services planned. The subscription (e-mail based) service and the company specific services.

Limits and scope:
We plan on supporting all the harbours that the RTF data base supports.
We plan on removing functions form the add-on parts if neccessary.


Additional thoughts and vision:
If the plattform is modular enough we can invite other projects/groups to attach their products
as add-ons on this plattform.
