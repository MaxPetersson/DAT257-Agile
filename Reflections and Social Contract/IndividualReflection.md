<h2>Karin</h2> 
    Since this is the second week and we just now decided what the project will be about - there is little to reflect on regarding the project itself. However, I can reflect some on the organizaiton of the project and the current situation. 
    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
        A. I have very little experience in writing user stories.
        B. I want to learn how to write clear and "reasonable" user stories and to break them down/"slicing" them correctly.
        A->B. To achive B, I need to study the course material and practice with group peers.
    2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
        I can help the group by sharing a small amount of scrum-like working experience.
    3. What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
        Not so much yet. The first sprint will be next week.
    4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
        Up until now, brainstorming and discussions to decide on a project scope.
