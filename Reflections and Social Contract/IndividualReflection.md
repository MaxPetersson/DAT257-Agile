<h2>Karin</h2> 
    Since this is the second week and we just now decided what the project will be about - there is little to reflect on regarding the project itself. However, I can reflect some on the organizaiton of the project and the current situation. <br>
    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
        A. I have very little experience in writing user stories.<br>
        B. I want to learn how to write clear and "reasonable" user stories and to break them down/"slicing" them correctly.<br>
        A->B. To achive B, I need to study the course material and practice with group peers.<br>
    2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
        I can help the group by sharing a small amount of scrum-like working experience.<br>
    3. What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?<br>
        Not so much yet. The first sprint will be next week.<br>
    4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?<br>
        Up until now, brainstorming and discussions to decide on a project scope.<br>

<h2>Philip</h>
    1.What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
        A. I do not know what a good reflection looks like.
        B. I want to learn how to reflect and somehow know if something is good to reflect about at all or not.
        A->B. To go from A to B, I need to keep reflecting on things I do and talk to others about their reflections.<br>
    2.How can i help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
        I can research on something related to this course and share that information.
    3.What is my contribution towards the tea's use of scrum?<br>
        Apart from perhaps good discussions, not much.
    4.What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?<br>
        Perhaps good spirit and keeping the meetings focused on agreeing on something as a team.

<h2>Dara</h>
    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
        A. I have a little experience in the use of Scrum.<br>
        B. I want to learn and apply the use of Scrum more in-depth.<br>
        A->B. To achieve B, I need to get some "field experience" of Scrum since I think that is the way to go to learn it as fast as possible. <br>
        2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
            I can talk to my peers and even though I might not understand their problem I can get them on track by sharing my thoughts.<br>
        3. What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?<br>
            At the moment not very much. I shared my thoughts on what and what not I think should and shouldn't be on the scrum board.<br>
        4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?<br>
            We haven't as of yet actually started implementing our project. We have only come up with ideas of what we should work on. Therefore the only thing I have contributed with towards my team is ideas and discussion.<br>
