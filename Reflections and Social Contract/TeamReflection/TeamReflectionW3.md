Team Reflection W3.
23/9.

*Social Contract and Effort*
Our view on the social contract at first was very vague. After receiving feedback on the contract being too general we added more specific ”code of conducts” and it became very much clearer.

*Customer Value and Scope*
Nothing has been delivered to any product owner, however our internal process has been working fine. We managed to finish whatever we decided to finish before the sprint ended. This includes a ”hello world” and a more sophisticated social contract.

*Social Contract and Effort*
The time we have focused on the actual project and deliverables has been mirrored in the result. Accounting for several hours lost in staff-absence we feel that we have delivered a good amount of deliverables inside the project.

*Social Contract and Effort*
A lot of time has been spent on administration within the project. We still feel that the project’s deliverables match the time spent on them.
