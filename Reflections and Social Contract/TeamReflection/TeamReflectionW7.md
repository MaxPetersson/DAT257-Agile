Team reflection 21/10.


* Customer Value and Scope *

This sprint we chosed to focus on a user story that was asked for by the product owner two weeks ago. We did not receive any new priorities. 
There was one feature that we wanted to implement but we deemed it impossible to make it within the sprint. Considering it was the last sprint we will not be able to deliver it. 


* Social Contract and Effort *

The social contract remains unchanged and everything we agreed upon still works well.


* Design decisions and product structure *

Naturally the last sprint brought some extra clean-up with it and we spent some time to document whatever code that was not yet documented.


* Application of Scrum *

Our mondays marks the end and start of a new sprint. After weeks of practising scrum we feel that our mondays have become far more effecient.
Both in terms of closing up the recent sprint but mainly in terms of preparing for the coming sprint.
