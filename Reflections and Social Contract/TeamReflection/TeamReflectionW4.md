Team Reflection W4.
30/9.

*Design decisions and product structure*
	This is a very demanding topic for us. Considering all the different perspectives of the project and the varied experience within the group this part consumes a lot of time and energy. The members feel that it's very hard to take decisions on their own, however it's very time consuming to discuss every single decision with everyone.

*Social Contract and Effort
	Mainly effort: The group feels that A LOT of time has been spent on the project idea & scope. Even if we finished the scope the first week it's still time consuming when we consider different perspectives, priorities and experience. Many of the working hours are still put into technology-discussions, idea breakdowns and so on.


*Application of Scrum
	The agile practise of having a scrum master significantly increased our efficiency during meeting. Specifically compared to last week when our scrum master was sick, and not replaced, we almost halved the time for our meeting.

*Application of Scrum

	Even though a lot of our time has gone into refining scope and its different perspectives, we feel it is in perfect relation to literature and lectures. According to provided lectures, our reflections are in line with what scrum beginners' should be.


ESI: 3,5 / 5,0.
