Team reflection 14/10.


* Customer Value and Scope *

Our acceptance criterias made the tasks and user stories easier to follow and complete. It also made sure that we did not take the easiest way when completing the user story.

Our WIP-KPI's kept the different columns in Trello under check. We are still happy with the values we picked.

* Social Contract and Effort *

The social contract remains unchanged. This sprint was the second sprint in a row when we mainly developed together in the team. We had co-programming sessions and could deliver a lot more than previous weeks when we split up to work on our own.


* Design decisions and product structure *

Having spent a lot time co-developing as the entire team we feel that the structure of the project and the code have both improved. 


* Application of Scrum *

The working flow when planning for the sprint(s) has improved. We have focused a lot more on what the product owner wanted us to prioritize. We discarded a few tasks and user stories based on that. 

The entire team feels that we can focus more on developing during developing-sessions because we have improved our user stories- / tasks writing.
