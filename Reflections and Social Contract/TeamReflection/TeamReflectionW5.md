Team reflection 7/10.

* Design decisions and product structure *

We got feedback on how we started dealing with our design decisions and after that we changed the approach. We completely left out the data-layer and focused on the front-end only. This was done to make sure we could deliver some value to the owner.


* Application of Scrum *

This sprint we had a longer session of peer-programming and noticed that we could be very efficient this way. We managed to deal with more appropriately sized tasks. 

* Social Contract and Effort *

Our social contract is working fine (after the first initial updates) so we are keeping it the way it is. The total effort of the group seems fine and we feel that we deliver a good amount even though we’ve had some absent staff.

* Customer Value and Scope *

WIP-limits: We didn’t lower these limits even though we were a bit short of staff. Which meant it was a bit easier for us to keep the number of tasks below the limit.
