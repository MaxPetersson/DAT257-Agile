    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
        A. I find building a functioning website from scratch harder than I thought it would be.<br>
        B. I want to learn how to set up a website. More specifically how to use JavaScript to build html elements and dynamically fill them with information.<br>
        A->B. To achive B, I need to search the web for info and find out what works best/easiest.<br>
    2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
        A. At the moment I don't know javascript good enough to teach any of the other members to do something. <br>
        B. I want to be able to show how to build html elements using javascript.<br>
        A->B. Once I get comfortable with modifying/building html with js I'll be able to show the others how it can work. <br>
    3. What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?<br>
        A. I've code reviewed a finished task. <br>
        B. I want to work faster and more efficiently. Asking for help when/if needed.<br>
        A->B. To achieve B I need to communicate more with the group when we work remotely.<br>
    4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?<br>
        A. I took on a task that I wasn't able to finish. Asked for help a bit too late. <br>
		B. I want to start working on the tasks I take on earlier and make sure to know exactly what I'm doing, or else ask for help. <br>
		A->B. I need to become better at communicating any uncertainties. <br>

<h2>Max</h2>
<br>
	1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
		A. The balance of scrum mastering and development.
		B. It's very hard to plan for development times and estimates when you're not familiar with the technology.
		A->B. It would probably be wise to divide the project into a few parts/areas so that one or more members of the group can "be responsible" for a certain area or technology.
 	2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
		A. I have a small amount of experience when it comes to the general concept of web-programming.
		B. Get, those involved, on the same page.
		A-B. I can inform any affected member(s) of the group of whatever experience that is.
	3. What is my contribution towards the team use of Scrum? <br>
		A. Writing user stories and breaking them into tasks.
		B. Smaller user stores and tasks.
		A->B. Suggest much smaller user stories.
	4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?<br>
		A. General ideas and thoughts of how we should solve problems.
		B. I want to develop more and scrum more.
		A->B. It's hard for the group to decide WHAT to do and HOW because of lack of experience.
