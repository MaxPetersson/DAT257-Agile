	1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
		A. The balance of scrum mastering and development.
		B. It's very hard to plan for development times and estimates when you're not familiar with the technology.
		A->B. It would probably be wise to divide the project into a few parts/areas so that one or more members of the group can "be responsible" for a certain area or technology.
 	2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
		A. I have a small amount of experience when it comes to the general concept of web-programming.
		B. Get, those involved, on the same page.
		A-B. I can inform any affected member(s) of the group of whatever experience that is.
	3. What is my contribution towards the team use of Scrum? <br>
		A. Writing user stories and breaking them into tasks.
		B. Smaller user stores and tasks.
		A->B. Suggest much smaller user stories.
	4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?<br>
		A. General ideas and thoughts of how we should solve problems.
		B. I want to develop more and scrum more.
