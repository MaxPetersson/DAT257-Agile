<h2>Karin</h2> 
<br>
    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
        A. Today I know more about building html elements dynamically using JavaScript.<br>
        B. I want to continue to learn how to populate html elements with information based on user inputs.<br>
        A->B. To achive B, I need to continue to search the web for info and not hesitate to change direction when something doesn't work.<br>
    2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
        A. This sprint, I was able to co-program with other group members and solve tasks together.<br>
        B. I want to continue to be open towards trying out other group members' ideas to solve problems.<br>
        A->B. To achieve B, I'll encourage the group to start working early on in the sprint (minimize time spent on discussing things thar might be unneeded) and work together when possible (maximize time spent co-programming.<br>
    3. What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?<br>
        A. This sprint I've contributed more efficiently than last sprint, finishing two tasks related to the current user stories together with a group mate as well as reviewed code for other tasks. I did not work remotely this sprint.<br>
        B. I want to continue to work the same way.<br>
        A->B. To achieve B I need to make sure to ask for help/other ideas when/if needed.<br>
    4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?<br>
        A. I felt that the project moved forward pretty well this sprint. I was able to start working much earlier than last sprint, and with user stories and tasks that we would finsih rather quickly.<br>
		B. I want to keep working the same way.<br>
		A->B. I should continue to communicate any uncertainties and work as efficiently as possible.<br>

<h2>Philip</h2> 
<br>
    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
        A. I do not know how important it is to stick to the commited user stories(and not more/less). (Why cant we pick more UserStories if we have time?)
        B. I want to understand and know how to use Scrum effectivly for results, not because "scrum rules said so"
        A->B. I need to talk to one of the teachers our group and get good feedback, they probably know.
    2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
        A. Sometimes we are talking very technical about how something should be done, even though we might even never do it.
        B. I wish we could drop conversations that will probably never lead to anything productive.
        A->B. I'll strive to ask relevant questions in those discussions and perhaps we can relise it is not needed.
    3. What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?<br>
        A. We sometimes make things more complicated the we need.
        B. I would like the team to push for results and perhaps not the most elegant solutions.
        A->B. I will encourage the team to go for the most simple solution that comes to mind so that we can get things done.
    4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?<br>
        A. I helped making all the cards done for our sprint.
        B. I want to continue doing this until project is over.
        A->B.I will keep doing tasks and codeReviewing and handling git merge conflicts.

<h2>Oscar</h2> 
<br>
	1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
		A. I have become better at programming a website and know more about how to call functions from a JS in HTTP.<br>
		B. I want to become better at making tasks vertical.<br>
		A->B. I need to think about how touch all layers, and write tasks incremental. <br>
 	2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
		A. I still feel that we can follow the practice of scrum better. We are doing as much of it as we can, but I <br>
		still think that tere are room for improvement.<br>
		B. I want to be able to plan ahead so that we can work more efficient when the entire group meet.<br>
		A->B. I want us to make new estimates.<br>
	3. What is my contribution towards the team use of Scrum? <br>
		A. I rewrote our US according to the feedback we had gotten. Now they are written so that it is easier for the <br>
		product owner to see the value.<br>
		B. I want to be better at estimating resourses of tasks and US. I also want to be able to write good vertical tasks.<br>
		A->B. I have to keep estimating and re-estimating US and tasks. I need to write icremental tasks that involves<br>
        all "layers".<br>
	4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?<br>
		A. I compleated 2 userstories together with my team. We co-programmed and woked as a unit. I kept focus on<br>
        delivering results the easiest way possible.<br>
		B. I want to stay on the path of delivering results, don't over complicate solutions.<br>
		A->B. Work incrementally. Make sure it works before making it grand and "coplicated".<br>

<h2>David</h2>
<br>
    I fell ill at the end of last sprint and haven't been able to neither reflect nor work.<br>

    I fell behind in the project.
    I want to catch up.
    I should participate in meetings and read last weeks protocols.
