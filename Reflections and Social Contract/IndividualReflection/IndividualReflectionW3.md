<h2>In the individual reflection, please address the questions using the A, B, A -> B reflective loop.</h2> <br>
... the current situation or "what is" (A), <br>
... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and <br>
... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).<br>

<h2>Karin</h2> 
<br>
    General comment; I need to ask the teachers/supervisors for some comments about how to write these individual reflections as it seems a bit hard to ansver every question using the "A, B, A -> B reflective loop."
    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
        A. I still have som problems creating good user stories and tasks. They easily become too vague/abstract.<br>
        B. I want to become better at writing user stories and tasks according to the 'INVEST' and 'SMART' guidelines.<br>
        A->B. To achive B, I need to study the course material and discuss with the other group members when working with  writing tasks.<br>
    2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
        A. I have a small amount of scrum-like working experience. <br>
        B. The whole group should be "one the same page" regarding how we are working.<br>
        A->B. When discussing tools, work flows, git organization etc. I can share what I have worked with as a suggestion.<br>
    3. What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?<br>
        A. So far I have for example contributed with coming up with user stories and tasks based on our (first, and possibly only) epic. <br>
        B. I want to contribute more with following the scrum guidelines/flow, and sticking with the social contract. <br>
        A->B. I need to remember all the steps specified in the "scrum loop" and do what we have agreed on per the social contract.<br>
    4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?<br>
        This question is tricky to ansver using the A, B, A -> B reflective loop. I'll write a sentence instead.<br>
        This sprint, I have contributed with finding a good-for-now table template for our page and, together with Dara, figured out how to implement it, add mock data to it and view it as a html page in a web browser.<br>
<br>

<h2>Philip</h2>
<h1>what do I want to learn or understand better?</h>
A. I want to understand how to get the correct data into our actual homepage.
B. I want to have knowledge out the database that we have access to.
A->B. I need to study the api given on canvas.
<h1>how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?</h>
A. We sometime drift away with discussions.
B. I want more effecient meetings and settling things faster.
A->B. I can try helping the team by sometime interrupt discussions irrelevant to the task.

<h1>what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?</h>
A. I do not know have to contribute towards the use of Scrum.
B. I do not understand Scrum.
A-B. I need to understand Scrum better so that I know what to improve on, and then help our team.

<h2>Dara</h2> 
<br>
    1. What do I want to learn or understand better?<br>
       A. Since we haven't really started with implementing stuff but only been discussing possible user stories etc I think the definitions of user stories and tasks is still quite unclear/difficult to define.<br>
       B. I want to understand and be able to produce good user stories at a higher rate.<br>
       A->B. I need to look up different user stories to different epics, and actually write some even if they are to big/small, to gain a better understanding.<br>
    2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?<br>
       A. I have experience in web design.<br>
       B. I want to share my experience with the team.<br>
       A->B. I can tell my team about my experiences.<br>
    3. What is my contribution towards the teams use of Scrum?<br>
       A. I have explained different git concepts/operations such as "rebase".<br>
       B. I want to share more knowledge about git.<br>
       A->B. Keep sharing knowledge when needed and if it exists.<br>
    4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?<br>
       The same as Karin (see above). Created a shell web site, simple layout to have a base to work on during the next sprint.<br>

<h2>David</h2>  
<br>
1.
    I want to learn more about NeTEx and SIRI<br>
    I should be able to tell the two schemas apart without getting a headache<br>
    Reading only the parts relevant to our project in both schemas<br>

2.
    I can share my current knowledge of NeTEx and SIRI<br>
    I should know exactly what part of the schemas are needed for our back end<br>
    Reflect on current knowledge with group and see what exactly is needed, then get back to reading<br>

3.
    I had a part in putting words to our current vision, first epic, and user story<br>
    There might be room for more epics and user stories<br>
    We could discuss more according to INVEST<br>

    I havent contributed to this weeks deliveries, other than updating social contract and trello<br>
